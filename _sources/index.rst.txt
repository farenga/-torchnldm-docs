TorchNLDM Documentation
=====================================

Using TorchNLDM
----------------

:doc:`installation`
    How to install the library.

:doc:`usage`
    How to use the library.


TorchNLDM Modules
-----------------

:doc:`torchnldm.data`
    Module performing data handling and preprocessing. It provides the ``DataLoader`` class, which facilitates dataset loading with methods dedicated to batches and trajectories sampling. Additionally, the ``DataScaler`` class is available for performing normalization and feature scaling tasks.

:doc:`torchnldm.model`
    Module including the ``NLDMBase`` class, serving as a base class for  ``NLDM`` and ``NLDF`` implementations. It also includes components related to autoencoders and neural differential equations.

:doc:`torchnldm.train`
    Module containing the ``Trainer`` class, handling the models' training routine.

:doc:`torchnldm.evaluate`
    Module containing the ``Evaluator`` class, handling the models' evaluation routine.

:doc:`torchnldm.utils`
    Module consisting of several submodules serving different purposes. It includes utilities for error metrics calculation, pre-implemented neural networks modules used as the building blocks of the main models' components, and plot utilities for visualizing results and performances.
